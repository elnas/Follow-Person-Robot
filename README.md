# Multi-Application Implementation Using Path Planning and Computer Vision
This repository is a catkin workspace for multiple use case implementation using path planning and computer vision on an Ohmni telepresence robot.

## Getting started
This respository contains different ROS packages. You need to have ros-noetic installed on your machine. The [Report](https://gitlab.svccomp.de/svccomp-students/research-project/2022/robotics-path-planning/report) contains detailed information on how to run each application on the Ohmni Robot.

### Prerequisite
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-tf2-sensor-msgs
sudo apt install flex bison freeglut3-dev libbdd-dev python-catkin-tools ros-$ROS_DISTRO-tf2-bullet

## Build
1. Go to your catkin workspace.
4. Build your catkin workspace using catkin_make.
